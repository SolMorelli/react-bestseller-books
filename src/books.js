    This file makes use of the named export. 
    It can only be used once in the same js file.
    We don't need to use its exact name when imported, we can change
    the name in the file we use it because we're only exporting one
    thing at a time.
    The result will look like this: import { Book } from './Book'
                                                ^ exact name in curly braces
